			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>We are a full service bicycle shop located in the heart of Berlin. We believe the best way to see the city is on your own set of wheels. Bike Berlin offers affordable, used bikes for tourists and locals alike.</p><br>

			<p>Scott and Brad Cohen, brothers from San Francisco, opened Bike Berlin in 2012. They visited Berlin during the summer of their senior year of college. The brothers rented bicycles to explore the city and loved the experience so much they decided to stay. </p><br>

			<p>We hope to see you at Bike Berlin soon!</p>
